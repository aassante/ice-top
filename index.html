						<br />
						Early initiation of hypothermia within the Golden Hour of acute care is essential to provide prophylactic treatment to limit the progression of injury.<br/>
						<br />
						Thermocrown is the first practical EMS hypothermia device specific for the treatment of TBI and is designed to move hypothermia treatment for TBI from the in-hospital to the pre-hospital or acute care setting. The cooling rate is controlled and moderate to maximize the safety profile and to prevent side effects. <br />
						<br />
						Thermocrown is effective, safe, portable, affordable in large quantities, and suitable for use globally without modification.<br />
						<br />
						The IP is secured in major domestic and international markets.<br /></p>
